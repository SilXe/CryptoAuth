Web3 Authentication App 🚀

A React & Express.js application that implements Web3 login authorization using smart contracts and NFTs to differentiate user roles (Member, Intern, Manager). Users sign in with their crypto wallets instead of traditional credentials.

⚡ Tech Stack

  Frontend: React.js, React Router, Styled-Components

  Backend: Node.js, Express.js, CORS

  Web3: ethers.js, MetaMask Integration

  Version Control: GitHub

  Smart Contracts (Upcoming): Solidity, Hardhat

🚀 Setup & Installation

  1️⃣ Clone the Repository
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
  cd web3_auth_app

  2️⃣ Install Dependencies
  Frontend

    cd frontend
    npm install

  Backend

    cd ../backend

    npm install


🎯 Running the App

  1️⃣ Start the Backend
    cd backend
    node server.js
  Backend runs on http://localhost:5000/

  2️⃣ Start the Frontend
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
  Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000/

  3️⃣ Run Both Frontend & Backend Simultaneously
    From the root directory (web3_auth_app), run:

    npm install --save-dev concurrently

    npm start

  This will start both the backend (5000) and frontend (3000) at the same time.

🔑 Web3 Authentication Flow

  User connects their MetaMask wallet.

  The app verifies the wallet address.

  Based on NFT ownership, the system assigns roles (Member, Intern, Manager).

  User gets access to features based on their role.

🛠 Environment Variables (.env)

  Inside the backend directory, create a .env file:

    PORT=5000

    INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_key

    PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key

  Replace with your actual credentials.
